# stereo-to-mono-audio-amp

to use this, cut off a earphone, or any stereo audio output, solder the left and right stereo terminal into the appropriate smd pads, and for the speaker, same as the earphone, solder the +- terminals into the +- output. and power into the power terminals. As a result you should get a amplified mono audio! :D
